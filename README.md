# Sorty (URL shortener)
### A URL shortener that  minimizes URLs into something easier to remember and track i.e. a POKEMON. 


* It uses the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch the Pokemon and link it with the user's URL  
* The current expiry is set to 30 minutes as only 500 Pokemon can be fetched from the API.  
* The framework used is **Nextjs** and the primary database is **Postgres SQL**.  
* **Prisma** is used as the ORM.  
* It also has a cache layer and uses **Redis** as the cache database.  
* It uses **tailwind** as a styling framework.  
* Currently working on building the docker image, deploying it on the cloud, and making the UI mobile-friendly.
